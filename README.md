### Hi there 👋

🌱 I work at the intersection of data science and health. Specifically, I develop scalable methods and open-source software for biomedical data analysis leading to an improved understanding of human health and disease. I work to made these spaces more welcoming, diverse, and inclusive.

👩‍💻 I am an Assistant Professor of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins, faculty member of the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab, and affiliations with the Center for Computational Biology, the Department of Genetic Medicine, and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 

🎧 I’m also a co-host of the The Corresponding Author podcast, member of the Editorial Board for Genome Biology, an Associate Editor for Reproducibility at the Journal of the American Statistical Association, and co-founder of R-Ladies Baltimore.

👩‍🏫 I have received several awards for my work, including the NIH K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award, the Teaching in the Health Sciences Young Investigator Award, and the COPSS Leadership Academy from the American Statistical Association (ASA), arguably the statistical profession’s most prestigious award for early career leaders in Statistics and Data Science.
